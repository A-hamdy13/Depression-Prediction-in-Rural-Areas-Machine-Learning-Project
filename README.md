# Depression-Prediction-in-Rural-Areas-Machine-Learning-Project
Machine learning project on depression prediction in rural areas. Includes preprocessing, feature selection, handling class imbalance, and experiments with multiple ML models and ensembles.

# Depression Prediction in Rural Areas – Machine Learning Project

This project explored **predicting depression in rural populations** using a dataset with demographic and family-related features (e.g., marital status, family size).  
The main goal was to practice the **end-to-end machine learning workflow** — from preprocessing to evaluation — while experimenting with different models and techniques.  

### Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Dropped irrelevant columns  
   - Handled missing values  
   - Checked data types  
   - Correlation analysis with heatmaps  

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Filter and wrapper methods  
   - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  

3. **Handling Class Imbalance**
   - Random oversampling and undersampling  
   - SMOTE  
   - Class weight balancing  

4. **Models Used**
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest (with hyperparameter tuning)  
   - Support Vector Machines (with multiple kernels, stratified CV)  
   - Decision Trees  
   - Naive Bayes  

5. **Ensemble Methods**
   - Bagging  
   - Boosting  
   - Voting  
   - Stacking  

6. **Other**
   - Multiple cross-validation techniques  
   - Simple **Tkinter GUI** for demo  

### Purpose
The project was designed as a **proof of concept** to demonstrate understanding of core ML techniques — preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and ensemble learning.
